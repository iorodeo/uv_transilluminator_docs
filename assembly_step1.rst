Instructions
----------------

The ballast and power entry with switch in the kit are partially assembled - wires have already been soldered to the power connector and the lamp ballast as described in a previous `Instructables step <http://www.instructables.com/id/UV-Transilluminator/step3/Connect-AC-power-to-ballast/>`_. In Step 1 you will mount these parts to the enclosure and use twist-on wire nut connectors to connect the power entry to the ballast. 


* Place the ballast onto the base plate and secure in place with the ballast screws. Tighten down with the screwdriver. Note the correct orientation of the ballast on the base plate below.

The twist-on wire nut connectors will be used to connect the two neutral (white) and live (black) wires. 

* Take the ends of the two black wires and line up the frayed ends. Twist the wires together.

* Insert the wire bundle into the connector and twist the connector clockwise until tight. It should fit tightly on the wires. Test by pulling on the connector to ensure if does not come off the wires.
