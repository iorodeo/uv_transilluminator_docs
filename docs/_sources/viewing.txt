Viewing a gel with the UV Transilluminator
=============================================
Once you have your mini-gel prepared and stained, place it onto the transilluminator underneath the hinged lid as shown in the Images below. Always operate the UV-B bulb with the hinged lid closed. Switch on the transilluminator. At this point you should see your DNA bands.

Safety Notes
---------------
The gel above has been stained with ethidium bromide. As ethidium bromide is a toxic chemical with strict safety protocols, it is only recommended that you use this dye in a lab with established handling, storage and waste disposal procedures in place. Other users are strongly recommended to use the less toxic dyes such as SYBR-Safe instead, which can be handled and disposed of more safely.
The transilluminator does come with a safety lid for viewing the gel. However, when the lid is not in place, safety glasses must be worn when operating the UV-B bulb.
