Version 2.0 enclosure modifications
--------------------------------------
The design of this current version 2.0 of the UV Transilluminator is a slight modification of the `UV Transilluminator v 1.0 <https://bitbucket.org/iorodeo/transilluminator_enclosure_v1>`_ described in a previous `Instructable <http://www.instructables.com/id/UV-Transilluminator/>`_ tutorial.  The design has been modified slightly as described below:

* Viewing window increased to 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm (v 1.0 was 7 cm2)
* Design now includes a 9 cm2 UV transmissive diffuser which sits above the UV bulb
* Power entry switch now sits on the side of the box for easier access within a commercial Imaging Enclosure
* Acrylic material used to make the five parts of the enclosure base and sides has been changed to 1/8" black acrylic (v1.0 was 1/4" black acrylic)
* An additional part on the top has been included in this design to prevent any light leakage around the sides of the transilluminator glass
* New enclosure dimensions: 19.8 cm long x 14.9 cm wide x 6.5 cm tall
* Changes to the hardware (see the project on Bitbucket for the new BOM)
* Safety lid (clear or amber) has been increased to 10 cm x 10 cm (v1.0 was 8.2 cm x 10 cm)
